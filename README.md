# DukeCordEx
DukeCordEx is commandhandler made ontop of ![Javacord](https://github.com/Javacord/Javacord) drawing inspiration from ![KordEx](https://github.com/Kord-Extensions/kord-extensions)
commandhandler and argument parsing system.   
## Aims/Features
- To simplify the cosmic horror that is javacord slash comamnd registration system while combining slash command registration and responding by taking a response handler Consumer
- To have an convenient argument parsing system where the responder consumer functions have an instance of a argument template inner class as a parameter (optional).
- Simplying and removing most hassles encountered with slash commands/chat commands   
## Warning - This is still a hobby project
I am not in anyway an experienced or very competant developer. This is a hobby project I mainly develop for my own usage. The code lacks any real documentation, and there are many parts that could be greatly improved.
I am still new to concepts like generics in Java that I have made use of in this project and I am still learning these concepts and how to best apply them. **This is the nature of this project. If you want that to change, contribute**
